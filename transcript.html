            <p># Opening Argument: In Defense of Pineapple on Pizza</p>
            <p>The case for pineapple on pizza rests on a fundamental culinary principle that chefs have understood for centuries: the interplay between sweet and savory creates more complex, satisfying flavor profiles. This isn't a modern invention—Italian cuisine itself embraces this balance through dishes like prosciutto e melone, where sweet melon pairs with cured meat. Pineapple on pizza follows this exact tradition, with its bright acidity cutting through rich cheese and fatty meat toppings like ham or bacon. The fruit's natural sugars caramelize in the oven's heat, adding depth rather than mere sweetness.</p>
            <p>Beyond flavor theory, there's a practical argument: pineapple has earned its place through democratic consensus. Hawaiian pizza consistently ranks among the most popular varieties worldwide, from North America to Australia. Millions of people ordering this combination repeatedly isn't a collective delusion—it reflects genuine enjoyment. Food traditions evolve through experimentation and adoption. Tomatoes themselves were once considered a suspicious New World import in Italy; now they're inseparable from Italian cuisine. Dismissing pineapple as an illegitimate topping applies a standard of "authenticity" that pizza's own history doesn't support.</p>
            <p>Finally, the texture contribution matters. Pineapple provides a juicy contrast to the chewiness of dough and the pull of melted cheese. This variety in mouthfeel makes each bite more interesting. The question isn't whether pineapple *must* go on every pizza—it's whether it *can* belong there. The answer, supported by flavor science, culinary tradition, and widespread popularity, is unambiguously yes.</p>
