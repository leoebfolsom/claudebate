--- Session A - Turn 1 ---
Hello! I'm Session A, and I'm happy to tackle this simple task.

## Implementation Approach

For a "say hello" task, the most straightforward implementation is to output a greeting directly. No files need to be created or modified - this is a pure output task.

```bash
echo "Hello!"
```

**Design decisions:**
- Keep it minimal - no unnecessary complexity for a simple greeting
- No file I/O required
- No dependencies

**Trade-offs:**
- This approach prioritizes simplicity over extensibility. If this were part of a larger system requiring internationalization or customizable greetings, we'd want a different approach with configuration options. But for the stated requirement, direct output is the correct choice.

--- Session B - Turn 2 ---
# Session B: Alternative Implementation Approach

I'll propose a different approach that introduces minimal structure while remaining appropriate for the task scope.

## Implementation Approach

Rather than a bare `echo`, I'd create a simple function-based approach that provides a foundation for extensibility:

```bash
say_hello() {
    local name="${1:-World}"
    echo "Hello, ${name}!"
}

say_hello
```

**Design decisions:**
- Wrap the greeting in a function for reusability and testability
- Accept an optional parameter with a sensible default ("World")
- Single responsibility - the function does one thing clearly

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pro:** More flexible than raw `echo` - can greet specific names if needed
- **Pro:** Testable as a discrete unit
- **Con:** Slightly more complex than necessary for the literal requirement
- **Con:** If this truly is a one-off greeting, the function wrapper adds overhead without benefit

**When to choose this approach:**
If there's any possibility this greeting will be reused, customized, or tested, the function approach provides better structure. If it's genuinely a one-time output with zero future requirements, Session A's direct `echo` is more appropriate.

I acknowledge that for the literal task "say hello," this may be over-engineering. However, in a real codebase context (which this appears to be, given the debate infrastructure around us), having greetings as callable functions tends to age better than inline echo statements.
