## Implementation Approach: "Say Hello"

For this simple task, I propose a minimal implementation that prints "Hello" to standard output. Given the trivial nature of this requirement, the most appropriate approach is a single-line solution that avoids over-engineering.

### Implementation

```python
print("Hello")
```

Or if we need a reusable function:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello")
```

### Design Decisions & Trade-offs

**Simplicity over extensibility**: I'm choosing the most direct implementation rather than building abstractions for hypothetical future requirements (like parameterized greetings, internationalization, or output formatting). If those needs arise later, they can be added then.

**No dependencies**: This uses only Python's built-in `print()` function, avoiding any external libraries for such a trivial task.

**Trade-off acknowledged**: This approach doesn't support customization (different names, languages, output destinations). However, for a "say hello" task, this is appropriate—adding configurability would be over-engineering. If the requirements expand, the implementation can evolve accordingly.
